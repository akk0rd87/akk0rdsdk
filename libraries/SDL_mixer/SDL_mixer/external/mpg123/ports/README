DISCLAIMER: The contents of the ports directory are included for convenience,
but they usually contain files contributed by various people, not the core
mpg123 team. The stuff is not tested by us. In some cases, it's even
impossible to tell what is really inside. Use at your own risk (well, like
all Free Software, actually;-).

This directory contains some (contributed) works covering usage and/or building
of mpg123/libmpg123 from different programming environments. Note that those
may be a bit outdated (especially when a file is added/removed in libmpg123
sources); as the team lacks resource to test everything. But in any case,
the ports can provide a good starting point on the respective platform, to get
it to work with minimal fuzz.

- cmake: CMake build to get started on non-Unix-like platforms, especially
  for just libmpg123 on Windows
- Sony PSP: Sony_PSP/; building libmpg123 for the PSP (used for the MODO player).
